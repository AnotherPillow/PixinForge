# PixinForge

[Pixin](https://github.com/AnotherPillow/Pixin) + [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) = PixinForge

This is a (1.8) forge port of [Pixin](https://github.com/AnotherPillow/Pixin). Initial gradle configuration based on [ModHider](https://github.com/Fabi019/ForgeModHider).

## Usage

1. Install Essential & PixinForge
2. Run the game once with Essential
3. Remove the original Essential jar from your mods folder
4. Copy the actual Essential mod from `<minecraft dir>/essential` (it'll be a .jar and be something like `Essential (forge_1.8.9).jar`) to your mods folder.
5. Run the game

## Clarifications of Licenses

- No, I'm not associated with Pixie or Essential.
- No, this doesn't use Essential code.
- Yes, ask me for licensing stuff Pixie people if you want. (or just do it yourself, it's not that complex of a thing to do (despite how long it took))
